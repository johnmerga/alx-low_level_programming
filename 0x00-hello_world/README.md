# Basics of C programming language

0. preprocessor

     > a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file

 1. compiler

    >  a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

 2. assembler
    > a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
    > * The C file name will be saved in the variable ```$CFILE```.
    > * the out put is been named the same as the C file, but with the extension ```.s``` instead of ```.c```
 3. name
    > a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named ```cisfun```.
4. puts.c
    >  a ```C``` program that prints exactly ```"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle``` ,followed by a new line.
5. printf.c
    > a C program that prints exactly ```with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,```, followed by a new line.
    > * only using printf
6. size.c
    >  C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. the program will print:

    > * Size of a char: 1 byte(s)
    > * Size of an int: 4 byte(s)
    > * Size of a long int: 4 byte(s)
    > * Size of a long long int: 8 byte(s)
    > * Size of a float: 4 byte(s)
    
7. intel 
    > a script that generates the assembly code``` (Intel syntax) ```of a C code and save it in an output file.
8. quote.c
    >   a ```C``` program that prints exactly ```and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19```, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

    > *  i didn't used any of ```printf ```or ```puts``` 
    > *  the program should ```return 1```
